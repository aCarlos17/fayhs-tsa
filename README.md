# TVL Strand Assessment (TSA)

[**TVL Strand Assessment (TSA)**](https://acarlos17.github.io/fayhs-tvlsa) is a self-assessment website developed as part of a research project at Flora A. Ylagan High School. The project aims to assist Grade 10 students in choosing a Technical-Vocational Livelihood (TVL) specialization that is currently available on the school. The research paper, titled “TVL Strand Assessment (TSA): A Self-Assessment Website for Grade 10 Students at Flora A. Ylagan High School” will be made available once the necessary permissions are obtained from the school and other related bodies.
